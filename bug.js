While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the 'metro-resolver' package. The error message was vague and didn't provide much detail.  The build process would halt, and the exact error message varied slightly on each attempt, making it hard to pinpoint the root cause.  I tried cleaning the cache, reinstalling node modules, and checking for conflicting packages, but none of these solved the issue. The error seemed to stem from an incompatibility or misconfiguration within the Expo CLI's dependency management system rather than an issue in my code.
