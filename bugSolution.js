The solution involved meticulously checking the versions of all packages, especially Expo CLI, React Native, and `metro-resolver` itself. It turned out that a combination of an older Expo CLI with a newer version of React Native and potentially other mismatched versions was causing conflict. The solution was to update the entire project to use compatible versions.

Here's what I did to solve this problem:

1. **Updated `package.json`:** I updated the Expo CLI, React Native, and related packages to their most recent compatible versions using `expo upgrade`. After upgrading, I carefully examined the `package-lock.json` for conflicts or potential issues and resolved them manually or by running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
2. **Cleaned the cache:** Ran `expo prebuild --clean` to ensure there weren't any lingering cache issues from the previous failed builds.
3. **Re-ran the build:** After these steps, the build process completed successfully.

It is very important to ensure your package.json contains compatible versions of all dependencies.  Updating Expo and React Native together is generally a good practice to avoid this sort of issue.
